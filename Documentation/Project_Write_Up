Keyboard
Mouse
HDMI Cable
USB (2.0)

-Software:
MountIt.sh (Script that creates a directory and mounts a specified Device there)
UnMountIt.sh (Unmounts from the Location created in MountIt.sh)
usbmon (kernel module that sniffs I/O from USB interfaces)
WriteBlockOn (Script to activate write blocking to a specified device)
WriteBlockOff (Script to deactivate write blocking to a specified device)
rpi-source (provides kernel headers needed to use Make Files)

Tests:
-Collect md5 and sha-1 hashes of the mounted device before and after is blocked
-Collect and Store access times on files located on the USB
